		Hi, I’m Jason. I’m a husband, a father, and most importantly, someone who wants to honor God by taking care of my family.
	</p>

	<p>
		As a father, my biggest dream is to give my daughter the best education and life experiences I can. I want her to grow up knowing that with faith, hard work, and kindness, she can achieve anything. As a husband, I want to give my wife the life she deserves – a life where she feels loved, secure, and blessed with everything her heart desires.
	</p>

	<p>
		I believe God has a plan for all of us, and I trust Him as I work toward my dream of building passive income. Over the next 5 years, I’m working on a business plan that will allow me to leave my current job so I can spend more time with my family. Whether it’s through creating digital products, affiliate marketing, or investing, my goal is to create income streams that will give us freedom – freedom to spend more time together, serve others, and live a full life without financial stress.

		This blog is part of my journey. I want to share what I learn so others can find their path to freedom too. I know it won’t always be easy, but with God’s help, I believe anything is possible.
	</p>

		Thank you for being here and walking this journey with me. Let’s trust the process, work hard, and put faith first every step of the way.
